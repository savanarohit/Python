### Statement Task

1. Let a = [1,2,3,4,5] use a for loop and print all odd and even numbers separately.

2. Let a = [1,2,3,4,5,6] then get a list b. which contains all even number from list a. example, List b should look like this. b = [2,4,6]

3. Take a range of numbers (0,50) and print ‘haha’ for numbers which are multiple of 3. print ‘hehe’ for numbers which are multiple of 5. print ‘heha’ for numbers which are multiple of both 3 and 5. print numbers which are neither multiple of 5 nor multiple of 3.

4. For a range (0,50). if a number is less than 10 do nothing. if greater than 10 print number print it. but if number equal to 30 exit the loop.

5. For number starting from 0-10 (include 10 also). print average of these numbers. Do it using for loop and while loop both.

6. Take range (0,20) and create a list of square of  all odd numbers.

7. Take value of length and breadth from user and then check whether it is square or rectangle. also print it.

8. Let say a school has following grade system.

    a. Below 25 - F <br>
    b. 25 to 45 - E <br>
    c. 45 to 50 - D <br>
    d. 50 to 60 - C <br>
    e. 60 to 80 - B <br>
    f. Above 80 - A <br>

    Now ask user to enter his int(marks) and print his grade accordingly.
